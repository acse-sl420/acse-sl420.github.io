I am a final-year PhD candidate at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), supervised by [Professor Matthew D. Piggott](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/m.d.piggott) and [Dr. Rossella Arcucci](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/r.arcucci). My research interests include deep learning, physics-based simulation, and statistical inference, with applications in scientific computing, engineering, and computer graphics.

I hold an MSc in Computational Science and Engineering from Imperial College London and MEng/BEng degrees in Mining and Industrial Engineering from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/).

During my PhD, I worked at [Autodesk Research](https://www.research.autodesk.com/) on geometric generation and at [Woven by Toyota](https://woven.toyota/en/) on AI agents, and I was a lead researcher in a [Shell](https://www.shell.com/)/Imperial collaboration on EV smart charging.
